This repository contains the code used in Aiden Karpf's thesis, largely inhereted from Brian Lee ([@ble000](https://github.com/blee000), PhD student at University of Rochester). ```HSF_v7.ipynb``` is the main jupyter notebook, and imports all relevant files and modules. More graphs displaying results are currently in progress, and will be locatecd in the "Results" folder.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
