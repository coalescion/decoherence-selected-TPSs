# decoherence-selected-TPSs
This repository contains the code used in Aiden Karpf's thesis, inhereted from Brian Lee ([@ble000](https://github.com/blee000), PhD student at University of Rochester) but with significant changes. The main jupter notebook is titled ```pred_vs_rob_TPS.ipynb``` and imports all relevant files and modules. Simulation data is stored in the files ```genscore_TPSdata.csv``` and ```minTPSdata.csv```. More graphs displaying results (particularly for Hamiltonians other than the Spinbath) are currently in progress, and will be located in the "graphs" folder.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
